## v2.3.1

### New Features

    - Adaptive moments now calculate the flux of the model rather than a weighted
      aperture flux.  The flux is a template flux (same method as
      PSFFluxFitter) and is thus nearly unbiased when fitting gaussian object.
    - Adaptive moments now fill in zero weight pixels using the current model.
      This avoids biases due to lack of symmetry in the input data.

## v2.3.0

### new features

   - Caching in pre-psf moments and metacal is now optional
     with an API to turn it on. Default is off.

## v2.2.1

### New Features

   - Added new guesser BDFPSFFluxGuesser, makes a flux guess
     based on the PSF flux

### Performance
   - Added O(N) phase shift computation for pre-psf moments

### Misc

   - ignore NumbaExperimentalFeatureWarning being spewed by
     numba.  We can ignore these, as the features are of order
     ten years old from the time of writing

## v2.2.0

### new features

   - Added function to regularize moments results.
   - Added numba to pre-PSF moments to reduce runtime.


## v2.1.0

### bug fixes

    - Fixed 1/area normalization for all moments fields in `GaussMom` results.

### new features

    - Added `fwhm_smooth` keyword to pre-PSF moments routines to allow for extra
      smoothing of the profile before the moments are measured.
    - Added caching of FFTs in metacal and pre-PSF moment rountines.
    - Added moments weight function normalization.
    - Changed `mom*` fields in the moments outputs to `sums*`.
    - Added `sums_norm` field to adaptive moments outputs.


## v2.0.6

### bug fixes

    - Fixed a bug where the `kind` attribute was not set for the `PrePSFMom` fitter.


## v2.0.5

### new features

    - implemented check for equality, copy() method, copy, and deepcopy
      for Gmix objects, jacobians, and Observation/ObsList/MultiBandObsList
    - added get_data() method for jacobian objects
    - added apodization to the pre-PSF moments to help prevent FFT artifacts

## v2.0.4

### new features

    - util.get_ratio_error and get_ratio_var support array arguments
    - added new function ngmix.gmix.gmix_concat to concatenate
      GMix objects into a combined GMix
    - It is no longer required to send a random number generator
      to the constructors for MetacalGaussPSF and MetacalAnalyticPSF.  If one
      is sent it is still used to add a small amount of noise.
    - The metacal codes now use a copy() of the input observations when
      creating their output.  This passes along all the internal data.

### bug fixes

    - Changes to ensure the "flux" result from the `AdmomFitter` is normalized
      the same as those from the other moments fitters.
    - In MetacalFitGaussPSF when using adaptive moments to get the psf
      model, be careful to use the fitted parameters rather than going through
      an intermediate gmix, which converts e1, e2 to g1, g2 and can fail in
      rare cases.
    - Some AdmomFitter failures were not being flagged properly.

## v2.0.3

### new features

    - All moments codes now produce similar output dictionaries and flags.
    - The `PrePSFGaussMom` class has been renamed to `PGaussMom`. The old name still
      exists for backwards compatibility but will be deprecated and removed at
      some future date.
    - The moments codes and `gaussap.py` codes now use np.nan for missing values.
    - The flag bits have been normalized across the code base to now all reside in
      `ngmix.flags`. A new function to convert the flags to a descriptive string is
      located there as well.
    - A new function exists to convert raw moments to shape results:
      `ngmix.moments.make_mom_result`
    - The moments fitters now have a `kind` attribute to help downstream code
      process them uniformly.
    - Added slots for position moments in moments output for moments fitters.

### bug fixes

    - Ensure only square images are accepted for pre psf moments codes
      KSigmaMom and PrePSFGaussMom

## v2.0.2

### new features

- Added `PrePSFGaussMom` fitter for computing pre-PSF moments in Gaussian
  apertures
- Test suite now runs in parallel using `pytest-xdist`
- Added `flux_flags` and `T_flags` fields to `KSigmaMom` and `PrePSFGaussMom`
  fitters for using just those quantities.
- Added `FFTRangeError` which is now raised if `KSigmaMom` or `PrePSFGaussMom`
  are using inconsistent FFT sizes given the kernel size.
- add `cenonly` option to adaptive moments, using a fixed gaussian covariance
  with only the center varying.  Added ngmix.admom.find_cen_admom function
  for finding the center.

### bug fixes

- Fixed bug identifying that adaptive moments had reached maximum
  number of iterations

## v2.0.1

### new features

- em fitting now supports fixed covariance matrices using the
  EMFitterFixCov, or equivalently the fixcov=True keyword to the run_em
  convenience function

### bug fixes

- fixed bug with sheared psfs in metacal, negative sheared psfs
  were not being cached.
- bug in psf guesser when using guess_from_moms that caused
  infinite recursion

## v2.0.0

### breaking API changes

- ngmix now evaluates models in flux units rather than surface brightness.
  Users whose images are in flux units previously had to include extra
  factors of pixel scale squared to get the right units, this is no longer
  the case.
- The fitters no longer take the observation in the constructor.
  All fitting/measurement conform to a common interface.  The classes have a `go`
  method that takes the observation and possibly a guess.
- The bootstrap and runner code has been completely replaced by a new api.
  The bootstrappers are now generic, wrapping runners that are themselves
  generic wrappers for fitters and guessers.  Thus the bootstrap/runner
  code is completely generic and can work with any of the fitters/guessers.
- The guessers now optionally take the observation as argument when called; this
  facilitates the cases where a guess can be made based on the observations.
- The em codes take GMix objects as guesses, a simple T guess is no longer
  supported
- The em codes now work in image flux units rather than normalizing the
  mixture
- all PDFs/priors sample methods take the option nrand=.  Some had previously
  taken n=
- fitters renamed:
    - LMSimple -> Fitter
    - LMCoellip -> CoellipFitter
    - TemplateFluxFitter -> PSFFluxFitter
    - GalsimSimple -> GalsimFitter
    - SpergelFitter -> GalsimSpergelFitter
    - MoffatFitter -> GalsimMoffatFitter
    - GalsimTemplateFluxFitter -> GalsimPSFFluxFitter
    - GMixEM -> EMFitter
    - Admom -> AdmomFitter
- Copies of observations now propagate the values of `store_pixels` and `ignore_zero_weight`.

### bug fixes

- metacal was reconvolving by the pixel *twice*, which resulted in larger
  reconvolved PSFs and thus somewhat lower, but still accurate, response than
  the pixel was included once.  This did not cause any bias.
- fixed computation of Jacobian center for `ngmix.KObservation`s with mixed
  even-odd dimensions
- the total shape amplitude `g` is now reset properly when using the
  `Shape.set_g1g2` method
- fixed large rounding errors in some shape conversions in `ngmix.shape`
- fixed bug in `ngmix.shape.g1g2_to_eta1eta2` in handling numpy array inputs
- fixed bug in `ngmix.shape.e1e2_to_eta1eta2` in handling numpy array inputs
- fixed bug in `ngmix.priors.GPriorBA.get_fdiff` in handling array inputs
- fixed a bug in `ngmix.priors.TwoSidedErf.get_fdiff` in handling array inputs
- fixed bug in `TruncatedSimpleGauss2D` where the truncation radius was applied about
  zero in some methods and not about the center
- fixed flux unit scaling in metadetect regression tests

### new features

- All fitters and measurement classes adhere to a common interface.
  `fitter.go(obs=obs)` or `fitter.go(obs=obs, guess=guess)`.  The obs
  is no longer taken in the constructor so the same object can be reused
  in the runners/bootstrappers for multiple measurements.
- Replaced boostrapper/runner classes with generic classes/functions that
  expect fitters/measurements and runners to provide common interfaces
  For fitters `fitter.go(obs=obs)` or `fitter.go(obs=obs, guess=guess)`
  For runners `runner.go(obs=obs)`.  New classes are bootstrap.Bootstrapper
  runners.Runner, runners.PSFRunner
- Expanded test suite and improved documentation for all modules
- introduced `NGmixBaseException` as parent class for all ngmix-specific exceptions
- New guessers `TPSFFluxGuesser`, `TPSFFluxAndPriorGuesser`, `GmixPSFGuesser`,
  `SimplePSFGuesser`, `CoellipPSFGuesser`
- New joint prior `PriorGalsimSimpleSep`
- Added guessers `TPSFFluxGuesser`, `TPSFFluxAndPriorGuesser`, `GMixPSFGuesser`,
  `SimplePSFGuesser`, `CoellipPSFGuesser`,
- New specialized EM fitting codes added:
    - GMixEMFixedCen: fit mixtures with fixed centers for each component
    - GMixEMFluxOnly: fit mixtures allowing only the fluxes to vary
- some refactoring of like modules into sub-packages.
- Added `mfrac` attribute to observations to hold masked fraction images.
- Added Python `@property` functions for `store_pixels` and `ignore_zero_weight`
  for `ngmix.Observation`.
- `setup.py` now gets the version from the package.
- Added new `KSigmaMom` fitter to measure pre-PSF weighted moments using the
  `ksigma` kernel from Bernstein et al.

### deprecated/removed

- The `LMSimple` class now supports the "bdf" and "bd" models and has been
  renamed to `LM`.  The `LMSimple` is now an alias for `LM` and is considered
  deprecated.  The `LMBDF` and `LMBD` classes have been removed.
- `ngmix.lensfit` has been removed in v2.0.0
- all `dbyg1_*`,  `dbyg2_*`, `dlnbyg1_*`, `dlnbyg2_*`, and `get_pqr*` methods,

- removed `GMixBDF` class.  The "bdf" is now supported by the `GMixModel` class
- removed the `roundify` and `stats` modules
- removed the "prepix" option for metacal
- removed guessers `RoundParsGuesser`, `MomGuesser`,
- switched from print to logging in many modules
